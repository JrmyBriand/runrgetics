\title{Lactic Capacity from Lactic Energy Duration Data}
\usage{
sprint_lactic_capacity(lactic_energy_duration, k1 = 20, k2 = 2000)
}
\arguments{
\item{lactic_energy_duration}{A tibble with the following columns: duration (s), lactic_energy (J/kg), corresponding to the average lactic energy expenditure over running duration. This data is used to fit the lactic energy model.}

\item{k1}{A double corresponding to the rising time-constant of the bi-exponential model. Default is 20.}

\item{k2}{A double representing to decaying time-constant of the bi-exponential model. Default is 2000.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the lactic capacity (in J/kg) extracted from the fitted lactic energy model.
}
\description{
Extracts the lactic capacity from the fitted lactic energy model based on the lactic energy duration data.
}
\examples{
men_lactic_energy <- sprint_lactic_energy_duration_graubner_nixdorf()
men_lactic_energy

 # Extract lactic capacity from the data

 sprint_lactic_capacity(men_lactic_energy)
