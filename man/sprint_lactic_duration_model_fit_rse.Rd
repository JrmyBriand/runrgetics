\title{Sprint Lactic Duration Model Fit Residual Standard Error}
\usage{
sprint_lactic_duration_model_fit_rse(
  lactic_energy_duration,
  t1 = 20,
  t2 = 1500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lactic_energy_duration}{A tibble with the following columns: duration (s), lactic_energy (J/kg), corresponding to the average lactic energy expenditure over running duration. This data is used to fit the lactic energy model.}

\item{t1}{A double corresponding to the rising time-constant of the bi-exponential model. Default is 20.}

\item{t2}{A double representing to decaying time-constant of the bi-exponential model. Default is 1500.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the residual standard error of the fitted lactic energy model.
}
\description{
Performs a non-linear least squares fitting of the lactic energy model to the lactic energy over
running duration data and returns the residual standard error of the fit.
