\title{Instantaneous Distance During Running Acceleration}
\usage{
acc_distance_model(time, tau, maximal_velocity)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{A vector of time points (in s)}

\item{tau}{A double representing the time constant of the exponential rise in velocity (in s)}

\item{maximal_velocity}{A double representing the maximal velocity (in m/s)}
}
\value{
A vector of instantaneous distances (in m)
}
\description{
Estimates the instantaneous distance during the acceleration phase of a sprint run. The model is based on an exponential rise in velocity.
