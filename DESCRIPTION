Description: A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing running energetics
    from velocity data. Functions are to calculate running power,
    estimate metabolic contributions of sprint running (aerobic, anaerobic alactic, and anaerobic
    lactic systems) and estimate anaerobic alactic and lactic capacities
    from a set of sprint running performances.analyze sprint performance. Designed for 
    sports scientists,coaches, and researchers, it enables indirect quantification of running
    energetics using a method initially proposed by di Prampero (2005).
