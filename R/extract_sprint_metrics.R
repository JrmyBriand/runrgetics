# single function

# from, splits, reaction time, distance, vmax
# 1. find velocity
# 2. find time velocities
# 3. find tau and vf
# 4. Set velocity, acceleration and distance model
# calculate power from velocity and acceleration

# returns a data frame with the following columns:
# time, velocity, acceleration, distance, cost of running and power


# Second function

#1. functions to propose a set of plots to analyse the sprint metrics.
