The `runrgetics` package offers a comprehensive framework to compute,
quantify, and analyze energy expenditure and metabolic power production
during running activities. It includes tools to calculate metabolic
power based on running velocity and acceleration. Furthermore, it
provides functions to estimate the contributions of different energy
pathways (alactic, lactic, and aerobic) to the total metabolic power
during sprint events. These calculations are grounded in the sprint
bioenergetic model proposed by [Briand et
al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-025-05831-0).

Additional updates to the package README will be made soon.

Further details on the article’s calculations are available in the
various vignettes included with the package.

## Installation
